# Step 1: Clone the Repo

## For Linux, Mac & Windows Command Line
Clone the repo into the directory of your choice using `git` and the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/koinos/koinos.git
```

This will make a folder in your chosen directory called `koinos`. Change into this directory using the following command:

```
cd koinos
```
Once you are in the koinos directory, point to the latest version. As of this writing, this will be v2.0.1.

```
git checkout v2.0.1
```

## For Windows Only 

You'll need to use `PowerShell` to complete the node intallation, but the intial setup can be done without command line.

Visit the following Link: https://github.com/koinos/koinos and navigate to `Releases` on the right hand side and click on the Latest version. The current version as of December 2023 is V2.0.1.
